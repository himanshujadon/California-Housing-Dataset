# California-Housing-Dataset

This repository consists notebook of various Regression Models on California Housing Dataset .
Various Models are:
1. Linear Regression
2. Polynomial Regression
3. Ridge & Lasso Regression

Using normal equation as well as SGD, all these models have been implemented.
Also, Hyperparameter tuning of all these models has been done using GridSearchCV and using the best parameter for the respective models, error and scores have been calculated.
